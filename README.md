Koliada Syntax Highlighting for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds syntax highlighting support for the Koliada programming language in Visual Studio Code.
Features

This extension provides syntax highlighting for Koliada files with the .kld extension. It highlights keywords (if, while, for, return) and strings using the double-quote (") delimiter.
Usage

To use this extension, simply open a file with a .kld extension in Visual Studio Code. The syntax highlighting should be applied automatically.
Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

    Download the koliada.tmLanguage.json file from the repository.
    Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the VSCode window (or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + X on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + X on macOS).
    Click on the three dots icon in the top-right corner of the Extensions view and select "Install from VSIX...".
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the koliada.tmLanguage.json file and select it.
    After installation, VSCode should recognize Koliada files with the .kld extension and apply the syntax highlighting.
